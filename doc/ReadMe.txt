Bottom Line: sources and headers that are still changing go in /src. Code that has crystallised should go in /lib & /include (actually you could keep all .libs and their .hs in /lib).



In Order to increase the readability and have a better structure of code,several folder have been created :
-bin : contains  the executable program
-data : where different types Data are stored 
-doc : documentation folder 
-inc : contains headers (.h) files 
-src : source code (.cpp)
classes in .h lib and constructors in .cpp source
