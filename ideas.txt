write with <<setw()<<data1<<setw()<<data2..
if a string contains a space IT MUST BE REPLACE WITH _ BEFORE PUT TO DATA_BASE
MODIFIED STRING MUST BE FLAGGED!!! (so we dont confuse them with strings that already contains _)
map THAT SHIT


-get input
-checks for format (if contains spaces then replace with _ and append it to our map)(if already exists in map then thats even better
-check data base
-return result


to keep data base indexed with use maps
to register beginning line and count


key :id 
value :the whole object


chaque mat a son ref/id dont le cout
